# 8-Puzzle-AI-ML-
Given a 3Ã—3 board with 8 tiles and one empty space. The objective is to place the numbers on tiles to match the final configuration using the empty space.

The puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal state. Instead of moving the tiles in the empty space we can visualize moving the empty space in place of the tile. The empty space cannot move diagonally and can take only one step at a time.
